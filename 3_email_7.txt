Dear Professor,

I hope you're having a good week. I'm currently working on Assignment 3, and I'm a bit confused about the requirements for the project section. It's not entirely clear how the theoretical concepts we discussed in class are supposed to be applied to the practical scenarios given in the assignment.

Could we possibly meet during your next office hours, or at a time that's convenient for you? I want to ensure I'm on the right track before proceeding further. Thank you very much for your help in advance!

Oh thx for the letter of recommendation last week!

Best wishes,
