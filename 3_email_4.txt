Dear Professor,

I hope you're having a good day. I am reaching out to request a letter of recommendation. I am applying for an internship program that focuses on environmental research, and I believe that your endorsement could greatly strengthen my application.

Given the tight deadline for the application, I would be incredibly grateful if you could provide the letter by next Wednesday. Please let me know if you need any additional information from my side to assist with your letter.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I appreciate your support and guidance.

Best regards,
