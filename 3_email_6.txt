Hey,

I hope you're doing great! I'm reaching out because I have a bit of a last-minute request. I've got to attend a conference this weekend, and our usual babysitter just canceled. I was wondering if you might be free to watch the kids on Saturday?

They would love to spend some time with you, and we've got that new board game they've been itching to try out. Plus, I'll stock the fridge with your favorite snacks as a thank you! Let me know if you're available.

Thanks a bunch!

Best,
Your sister Jan
